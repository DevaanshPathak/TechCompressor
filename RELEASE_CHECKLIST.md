## Building Distribution Artifacts

To build the distribution packages:

```bash
# Install build tools (if not already installed)
pip install build twine

# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info

# Build wheel and source distribution
python -m build

# Verify packages
twine check dist/*

# Expected output:
# dist/techcompressor-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
# dist/techcompressor-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

## Pre-Release Verification

Before publishing, verify:

```bash
# 1. Version check
python -c "import techcompressor; print(techcompressor.__version__)"
# Should output: 1.0.0

# 2. Run smoke tests
python -m pytest tests/test_release_smoke.py -v
# Should show: 14 passed

# 3. Run full test suite
python -m pytest -q
# Should show: 150+ passed

# 4. Test CLI
techcompressor --version
techcompressor --benchmark

# 5. Test GUI (optional - requires display)
techcompressor-gui
```

## Publishing Steps

See **publish.md** for complete instructions:

1. **Test on TestPyPI** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
   ```

2. **Create Git Tag**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Upload to PyPI**
   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

4. **Create GitHub Release**
   - Go to: https://github.com/DevaanshPathak/TechCompressor/releases/new
   - Select tag: v1.0.0
   - Title: TechCompressor v1.0.0
   - Copy release notes from RELEASE_NOTES.md
   - Attach dist files
   - Publish

## Post-Release Tasks

- [ ] Verify PyPI page: https://pypi.org/project/techcompressor/1.0.0/
- [ ] Test installation: `pip install techcompressor==1.0.0`
- [ ] Update GitHub badges (if applicable)
- [ ] Announce in GitHub Discussions
