# TechCompressor

**TechCompressor** is a modular, extensible, Python-based file and folder compression framework.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

TechCompressor aims to combine multiple classic and modern compression methods into a single intelligent compressor with optional encryption and GUI support. The project is designed with clean modular architecture, PEP 8 compliance, and maintainability in mind.

## ðŸš€ Future Roadmap

1. âœ… **Project setup & structure** *(Phase 1 - Complete)*
2. **LZW** algorithm implementation
3. **Huffman** coding implementation
4. **Arithmetic** coding implementation
5. **DEFLATE** integration (LZ77 + Huffman)
6. **AES-based password protection** for compressed data
7. **Folder & multi-file archiving** system
8. **Tkinter GUI** for user-friendly compression/decompression
9. **Command-line interface (CLI)** with rich argument parsing
10. **Optimization, profiling, and finalization**
