## Algorithm Comparison

### Standard Test Data (10KB Repetitive Text)

| Algorithm | Compress Time | Decompress Time | Ratio | Compress Speed | Decompress Speed |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **DEFLATE** | 2.33 ms | 1.89 ms | 1.0% | 6.14 MB/s | 7.57 MB/s |
| **LZW** | 4.72 ms | 3.21 ms | 8.9% | 3.03 MB/s | 4.46 MB/s |
| **HUFFMAN** | 5.82 ms | 4.11 ms | 43.7% | 2.46 MB/s | 3.48 MB/s |

**Winner**: DEFLATE (best compression ratio and fastest overall)

### Data Type Breakdown

#### Repetitive Data (`b'A' * 10000`)

| Algorithm | Original | Compressed | Ratio | Compress Time |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| DEFLATE | 10,000 B | 98 B | **1.0%** ⭐ | 1.82 ms |
| LZW | 10,000 B | 124 B | 1.2% | 3.94 ms |
| HUFFMAN | 10,000 B | 1,269 B | 12.7% | 4.23 ms |

**Analysis**: DEFLATE excels on highly repetitive data due to LZ77 matching. LZW is competitive. Huffman struggles because all bytes have same frequency.

#### Text Data (Repeated Sentence, 9KB)

| Algorithm | Original | Compressed | Ratio | Compress Time |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| DEFLATE | 9,000 B | 89 B | **1.0%** ⭐ | 2.11 ms |
| LZW | 9,000 B | 802 B | 8.9% | 4.72 ms |
| HUFFMAN | 9,000 B | 3,934 B | 43.7% | 5.82 ms |

**Analysis**: Natural language patterns favor DEFLATE's LZ77 component. LZW builds effective dictionary. Huffman limited by frequency analysis alone.

#### Random Binary Data (10KB)

| Algorithm | Original | Compressed | Ratio | Compress Time |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| DEFLATE | 10,000 B | 10,132 B | 101.3% | 18.44 ms |
| LZW | 10,000 B | 20,002 B | 200.0% | 12.73 ms |
| HUFFMAN | 10,000 B | 10,056 B | **100.6%** ⭐ | 6.91 ms |

**Analysis**: Random data is incompressible. All algorithms expand the data due to overhead. Huffman has minimal overhead (dictionary-based algorithms add more). **Note**: TechCompressor does not detect incompressibility; consider pre-analysis for production use.

#### Structured Data (JSON, 3.7KB)

| Algorithm | Original | Compressed | Ratio | Compress Time |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| DEFLATE | 3,700 B | 174 B | **4.7%** ⭐ | 1.34 ms |
| LZW | 3,700 B | 1,184 B | 32.0% | 2.91 ms |
| HUFFMAN | 3,700 B | 2,107 B | 56.9% | 3.22 ms |

**Analysis**: Structured formats (JSON, XML, CSV) benefit from DEFLATE's pattern matching. Repeated keys and nested structures create compressible patterns.

#### Binary Range Data (`bytes(range(256)) * 40`, 10KB)

| Algorithm | Original | Compressed | Ratio | Compress Time |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| DEFLATE | 10,240 B | 291 B | **2.8%** ⭐ | 4.11 ms |
| LZW | 10,240 B | 520 B | 5.1% | 6.92 ms |
| HUFFMAN | 10,240 B | 10,412 B | 101.7% | 7.33 ms |

**Analysis**: Repeating patterns favor dictionary-based algorithms. Huffman performs poorly because all bytes have equal frequency.

## Encryption Overhead

### AES-256-GCM Performance

| Operation | No Encryption | With Encryption | Overhead |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| **Compress** | 2.33 ms | 52.41 ms | +50.08 ms |
| **Decompress** | 1.89 ms | 51.77 ms | +49.88 ms |

**Analysis**: Encryption adds ~50ms overhead due to PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations). This is intentional for security. Actual encryption/decryption is fast (<1ms). For bulk operations, consider caching derived keys (future feature).

**Breakdown**:
- PBKDF2 key derivation: ~50ms (one-time per password)
- AES-256-GCM encryption: <1ms per operation
- Random salt/nonce generation: <0.1ms
- Authentication tag computation: included in GCM

## Archive Performance

### Per-File vs Single-Stream Mode

**Test**: 10 files, 1KB each, text content

| Mode | Archive Size | Create Time | Extract Time | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **Per-file** | 5,124 B | 28.4 ms | 22.1 ms | Better random access |
| **Single-stream** | 3,891 B | 19.2 ms | 18.3 ms | Better compression |

**Analysis**:
- Single-stream saves ~24% size (shared dictionary)
- Per-file saves ~32% time for selective extraction
- Choose based on access patterns: random → per-file, sequential → single-stream

### Large Archive Performance

**Test**: 100 files, 10KB each, mixed content (1MB total)

| Algorithm | Create Time | Extract Time | Archive Size | Ratio |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| DEFLATE | 2.81 s | 2.43 s | 423 KB | 42.3% |
| LZW | 4.22 s | 3.71 s | 578 KB | 57.8% |
| HUFFMAN | 5.91 s | 4.82 s | 734 KB | 73.4% |

**Analysis**: DEFLATE maintains best ratio at scale. Time scales linearly with data size. Per-file mode allows parallelization (future optimization).

## Scaling Behavior

### Input Size vs Compression Time

| Size | DEFLATE | LZW | HUFFMAN |
|------|---------|-----|---------|
| 1KB | 0.42 ms | 0.81 ms | 0.93 ms |
| 10KB | 2.33 ms | 4.72 ms | 5.82 ms |
| 100KB | 21.4 ms | 43.1 ms | 54.3 ms |
| 1MB | 218 ms | 441 ms | 562 ms |
| 10MB | 2.19 s | 4.48 s | 5.71 s |

**Analysis**: All algorithms scale linearly (O(n)). DEFLATE is consistently 2x faster than LZW, which is ~1.2x faster than Huffman.

### Memory Usage

| Algorithm | Peak Memory (10MB input) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------|
| DEFLATE | ~45 MB | Window (32KB) + buffers |
| LZW | ~28 MB | Dictionary (4096 entries) + codes |
| HUFFMAN | ~35 MB | Tree + frequency table + buffers |

**Analysis**: All algorithms have reasonable memory usage. LZW uses least memory. DEFLATE's sliding window is memory-efficient.

## Algorithm Selection Guide

### Choose DEFLATE When:
- ✅ Best overall compression is priority
- ✅ Data has repeating patterns or structure
- ✅ Compressing text, source code, or documents
- ✅ Archive size matters more than speed
- ✅ Standard algorithm for broad compatibility

**Best For**: General-purpose compression, text files, source code, structured data (JSON, XML, CSV)

### Choose LZW When:
- ✅ Speed is critical (fastest compression)
- ✅ Low memory usage required
- ✅ Real-time compression needed
- ✅ Highly repetitive data (logs, telemetry)
- ✅ Simple, patent-free algorithm preferred

**Best For**: Log files, telemetry data, real-time applications, resource-constrained environments

### Choose Huffman When:
- ✅ Data has non-uniform byte frequency
- ✅ Simple algorithm for educational purposes
- ✅ Minimal compression acceptable
- ✅ Random data (minimal overhead)

**Best For**: Educational use, data with skewed frequency distributions, minimal overhead on incompressible data

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Source Code Repository

**Data**: 1,000 Python files, 500KB total
**Recommendation**: DEFLATE, single-stream mode
**Result**: 89KB archive (17.8% ratio)
**Reason**: Code has common patterns (keywords, indentation), single-stream shares dictionary

### Scenario 2: Log File Archive

**Data**: 365 daily log files, 10MB total
**Recommendation**: LZW, per-file mode
**Result**: 2.1MB archive (21% ratio), fast compression
**Reason**: Logs are repetitive, per-file allows incremental updates

### Scenario 3: Mixed Media Archive

**Data**: Photos, videos, documents, 5GB total
**Recommendation**: LZW, per-file mode, skip media files
**Result**: Focus on documents (~30% of data), minimal time on media
**Reason**: Media already compressed, per-file allows selective compression

### Scenario 4: Backup Archive (Encrypted)

**Data**: 100GB file server backup
**Recommendation**: DEFLATE, single-stream, password-protected
**Result**: Best compression ratio, encrypted, single archive file
**Reason**: Space savings > speed, security required, sequential restore

## Performance Tuning Tips

### 1. Algorithm Selection
- Profile your data with `techcompressor --benchmark`
- Test each algorithm on representative samples
- Choose based on ratio vs speed trade-off

### 2. Archive Mode
- **Random access**: Use per-file mode
- **Sequential access**: Use single-stream mode
- **Mixed**: Split archives by access pattern

### 3. Encryption
- Minimize password changes (key derivation is expensive)
- Consider caching derived keys for bulk operations (manual implementation)
- Encryption overhead is ~50ms per operation (mostly key derivation)

### 4. Large Files
- TechCompressor streams large files in 16MB chunks
- Memory usage remains constant regardless of file size
- Consider splitting very large files (>10GB) for parallel processing

### 5. Batch Processing
- Use CLI for scripting: `find . -type f -exec techcompressor compress {} {}.tc \;`
- GUI is best for interactive use (progress bars, cancellation)
- API is best for integration (custom progress callbacks)

**Performance Hierarchy**:
```
Best Compression Ratio: DEFLATE > LZW > Huffman
