# TechCompressor v1.0.0 — Comparison with WinRAR, WinZip, and 7-Zip

This document gives a concise comparison between TechCompressor (v1.0.0) and three widely used compression tools: WinRAR (RAR), WinZip (ZIP), and 7-Zip (7z).

Summary:
- TechCompressor: Research-oriented, three internal algorithms (LZW, Huffman, DEFLATE), AES-256-GCM optional encryption, TCAF archive format, focus on transparency and education.
- WinRAR (RAR): Proprietary format with strong real-world performance, solid compression ratios on many file types, integrated archiver with features like recovery records and solid archives.
- WinZip (ZIP): Ubiquitous format with PKZIP history; excellent interoperability, many implementations; modern ZIP variants support Deflate64, AES encryption, etc.
- 7-Zip (7z): Open-source native format with LZMA/LZMA2; typically best compression ratios for many inputs; supports AES-256.

1) Features
- TechCompressor
  - Algorithms: LZW (fast, simple), Huffman (optimal for skewed distributions), DEFLATE (LZ77 + Huffman)
  - Archive format: TCAF (multi-file, per-file or single-stream modes)
  - Encryption: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation)
  - Interfaces: CLI, Tkinter GUI, library API
  - Testing: Comprehensive test-suite (unit + integration)
  - Special mode: AUTO compression (tries all algorithms and selects smallest result)

- WinRAR
  - Proprietary RAR format, strong general-purpose ratios
  - Advanced features: solid archives, recovery records, multi-volume archives, incremental updates
  - GUI + CLI tools available

- WinZip
  - ZIP format (very widely supported)
  - Many implementations and variants; encryption available (AES in modern versions)
  - Fast and interoperable, but sometimes larger than 7z/RAR

- 7-Zip
  - 7z format with LZMA/LZMA2 (state-of-the-art ratios for many file types)
  - Good balance of compression vs memory usage (configurable)
  - Open-source and widely used for high compression needs

2) Compression ratio and speed (qualitative)
- TechCompressor
  - DEFLATE in TechCompressor aims for good ratios similar to gzip/deflate implementations but not tuned as heavily.
  - AUTO mode picks the best among internal algorithms; for some data (small, very repetitive) LZW wins; for others DEFLATE or Huffman wins.
  - Not optimized for maximum compression like LZMA; target is clarity, portability, and reasonable ratios.

- 7-Zip (7z/LZMA)
  - Typically best compression ratio for general-purpose data (often best or very close to RAR)
  - Slower than DEFLATE; memory usage can be higher

- WinRAR (RAR)
  - Very competitive ratios; sometimes beats 7z on specific datasets (e.g., multimedia with special dictionaries)
  - Balanced speed vs compression

- WinZip (ZIP/Deflate)
  - Fast decompression and good compatibility; ratios usually worse than 7z/RAR for many inputs

3) Encryption & security
- TechCompressor
  - AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations) — authenticated encryption
  - Per-file or whole-archive encryption supported; losing password is permanent (no backdoor)

- 7-Zip
  - AES-256 available for 7z; widely accepted and secure when used correctly

- WinRAR / WinZip
  - Support AES variants; security depends on chosen options and versions

4) Archive features & compatibility
- TechCompressor
  - TCAF is custom; requires TechCompressor to extract (not broadly compatible with external extractors)
  - Offers per-file mode (parallel-friendly) or single-stream (better ratio)

- ZIP
  - Highest interoperability: extractors on every OS
  - Less feature-rich compared to 7z/RAR unless using vendor extensions

- 7z / RAR
  - Good tools and libraries exist for most platforms, but still not as universal as ZIP

5) When to use TechCompressor
- Use TechCompressor when you need:
  - A compact, auditable Python implementation for research or teaching
  - AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption integrated with compression
  - A small, self-contained archive format for projects that will control both packing and unpacking

When not to use TechCompressor:
- If maximal compression ratio is the priority (use 7z with LZMA/LZMA2)
- If cross-platform compatibility without installing extra tools is essential (use ZIP)
- If you require advanced archiving features (recovery records, widely-supported multi-volume archives) — RAR is mature here

Notes & caveats
- Compression outcomes are data-dependent: the best algorithm varies with input type (text, binaries, images, multimedia)
- AUTO mode in TechCompressor tries internal algorithms and picks the smallest result; it is a pragmatic choice to avoid manual tuning
