## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in TechCompressor, please report it responsibly.

### Where to Report

**Please DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report security issues via:

1. **Email**: devaanshpathak@example.com
   - Subject: `[SECURITY] TechCompressor Vulnerability Report`
   - Include: Detailed description, steps to reproduce, impact assessment

2. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred):
   - Visit: https://github.com/DevaanshPathak/TechCompressor/security/advisories
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the private advisory form

### What to Include

A good security report includes:

- **Description**: Clear summary of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What can an attacker achieve?
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are vulnerable?
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: (Optional) Proposed mitigation or patch
- **Disclosure Timeline**: Your expectations for public disclosure

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **24-48 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **7 days**: Preliminary assessment and severity classification
- **30 days**: Fix development and testing (for confirmed vulnerabilities)
- **90 days**: Public disclosure (coordinated with reporter)

### Security Update Process

1. **Confirmation**: We confirm the vulnerability and assess severity
2. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a patch
3. **Private Review**: Reporter reviews the fix
4. **Release**: Security patch released as new version
5. **Public Disclosure**: CVE assigned (if applicable), advisory published
6. **Credit**: Reporter credited in CHANGELOG and security advisory (unless requested otherwise)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Password Security

1. **Use Strong Passwords**:
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
   - Avoid dictionary words and personal information
   - Use a password manager (e.g., 1Password, Bitwarden, KeePassXC)

2. **Password Storage**:
   - **NEVER** store passwords in code or version control
   - Use environment variables or secure vaults
   - Do not share passwords via email or chat

3. **No Password Recovery**:
   - TechCompressor has **no password recovery mechanism** by design
   - Lost password = permanent data loss
   - Test password before long compression operations
   - Keep secure backups of passwords

#### Encryption Best Practices

1. **Compression Pattern Leakage**:
   - Compressed data reveals patterns even when encrypted
   - For highly sensitive data, consider encrypt-then-compress or specialized tools
   - TechCompressor uses compress-then-encrypt (standard but not perfect)

2. **PBKDF2 Delay**:
   - ~50-100ms key derivation is **intentional** for security
   - Do not "optimize away" this delay
   - Protects against brute-force attacks

3. **Archive Security**:
   - Encrypted archives protect both metadata and contents
   - Authentication tag prevents tampering
   - Verify password immediately after encryption

#### Path Security

1. **Archive Extraction**:
   - Extract to known-safe directories only
   - Do not extract archives from untrusted sources without review
   - TechCompressor sanitizes paths, but review `list_contents()` first

2. **Archive Creation**:
   - Avoid creating archives inside source directory (triggers recursion error)
   - Be cautious with symlinks (rejected by default)

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Always validate user input (file paths, passwords, algorithm names)
   - Use `Path.resolve()` to canonicalize paths
   - Reject unexpected magic headers

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Do not leak sensitive information in error messages
   - Avoid exposing file paths in public errors
   - Log security events appropriately

3. **Cryptography**:
   - Use `cryptography` library (do not implement crypto primitives)
   - Always generate random salts and nonces
   - Never reuse nonces with the same key

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Keep `cryptography` library updated
   - Monitor security advisories: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/security/advisories
   - Run `pip-audit` regularly to detect vulnerable dependencies

#### Testing Security

1. **Security Test Coverage**:
   - Path traversal attacks: `tests/test_archiver.py`
   - Wrong password detection: `tests/test_crypto.py`
   - Magic header validation: `tests/test_integration.py`
   - Symlink handling: `tests/test_archiver.py`

2. **Fuzzing** (Future):
   - Consider fuzzing compressed data parsing
   - Test archive format parser with malformed input
   - Stress-test encryption/decryption

## Known Security Limitations

### Compression Pattern Leakage

**Issue**: Compressed data reveals patterns even when encrypted.

**Impact**: Attackers can infer information about plaintext by analyzing compressed ciphertext size and structure.

**Mitigation**:
- This is inherent to compress-then-encrypt schemes
- For maximum security, consider encrypt-then-compress workflows
- Alternatively, use specialized tools designed for encrypted archives (VeraCrypt, 7-Zip AES, etc.)

**Status**: Not a bug - architectural limitation documented in README and RELEASE_NOTES

### PBKDF2 Iteration Count

**Issue**: 100,000 iterations is a balance between security and usability.

**Impact**: More iterations = better security but slower performance.

**Configuration**: Currently hardcoded. Future versions may allow tuning.

**Recommendation**: 100,000 is acceptable for v1.0.0. Monitor OWASP guidelines for future updates.

### No Password Strength Enforcement

**Issue**: TechCompressor accepts any password (even weak ones).

**Impact**: Weak passwords are vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

**Mitigation**:
- User responsibility to choose strong passwords
- Consider adding password strength warnings in future versions
- Documentation emphasizes strong password requirements

**Status**: User education approach, may add UI warnings in future

## Security Audit Status

### Current Status

TechCompressor v1.0.0 has **not** undergone formal third-party security audit.

### Self-Assessment

- ✅ Use of industry-standard cryptography library (`cryptography`)
- ✅ Secure defaults (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2 with 100K iterations)
- ✅ No custom crypto implementations
- ✅ Path traversal protection
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ⚠️ Pattern leakage limitation (documented)
- ⚠️ No password strength enforcement (user responsibility)

### Future Plans

- Seek community security review
- Consider professional audit for v2.0.0
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD

## Vulnerability Disclosure History

### v1.0.0 (Current)
