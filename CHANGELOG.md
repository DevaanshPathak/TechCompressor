## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added

  - New `volume_size` parameter in `create_archive()` (e.g., 650MB for CD, 4.7GB for DVD)
  - Automatic splitting with sequential naming: archive.tc.001, archive.tc.002, etc.
  - VolumeWriter and VolumeReader classes for transparent multi-volume I/O
  - Seamless extraction across all volumes with automatic .001 detection
  - Volume size validation and overflow handling
  - Works with all algorithms, encryption, and compression modes
- **Incremental Backups**: Only compress files changed since last archive creation
  - New `incremental` parameter and `base_archive` reference in `create_archive()`
  - Timestamp-based change detection for efficient backup workflows
  - Dramatically reduces backup time and archive size for daily/weekly backups
  - Compatible with both per-file and solid compression modes
- **Enhanced Entropy Detection**: Automatically skip compression on already-compressed file formats
  - Expanded entropy detection for 40+ formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, MP4, MP3, ZIP, RAR, 7Z, PDF, etc.
  - Smarter heuristics reduce wasted compression attempts
  - Automatic STORED mode for incompressible files saves processing time
  - Configurable entropy threshold for fine-tuning detection
- **Archive Metadata**: User-defined metadata in archive headers
  - New `comment` and `creator` parameters in `create_archive()`

## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 - Production Release
TechCompressor v1.0.0 is the first production-ready release featuring three compression algorithms (LZW, Huffman, DEFLATE), AES-256-GCM encryption, custom TCAF archive format, and both CLI and GUI interfaces. All 137 tests pass, security features are fully implemented, and performance is optimized for typical use cases.

**Breaking Changes**: None (initial release)

**Migration Guide**: Not applicable (initial release)

**Known Issues**: 
- Compression reveals data patterns even with encryption (semantic security limitation inherent to compress-then-encrypt)
- PBKDF2 key derivation is intentionally slow (~50-100ms) for security
- No password recovery - data loss is permanent without password

**Recommended Usage**:
- Use DEFLATE for general-purpose compression
- Use LZW for speed-critical applications
- Use per-file mode for mixed content or selective extraction
- Use single-stream mode for similar files (source code, text)
- Always use strong passwords (12+ characters) for encryption
