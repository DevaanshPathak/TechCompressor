# TechCompressor v1.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: Production/Stable

## Overview

TechCompressor v1.0.0 is a production-ready, modular Python compression framework that brings together three powerful compression algorithms, military-grade encryption, and intuitive interfaces—all in a single package. Whether you're compressing large datasets, securing sensitive archives, or building compression into your applications, TechCompressor provides the tools you need with a clean, well-tested API.

## Highlights

### 🗜️ Three Compression Algorithms
Choose the algorithm that fits your needs:
- **LZW**: Lightning-fast dictionary-based compression (3 MB/s), ideal for repetitive data and speed-critical applications
- **Huffman**: Frequency-based compression optimized for non-uniform distributions (2.5 MB/s)
- **DEFLATE**: Industry-standard hybrid compression (LZ77 + Huffman) offering the best compression ratios (6 MB/s, ~1% on repetitive data)

### 🔒 Military-Grade Security
Password-protected compression uses **AES-256-GCM** authenticated encryption with **PBKDF2** key derivation (100,000 iterations). Every encryption generates unique salts and nonces, and includes integrity verification via authentication tags. There are no backdoors or recovery mechanisms—security by design.

### 📦 Flexible Archiving
The custom **TCAF** (TechCompressor Archive Format) supports both per-file and single-stream compression modes. Compress entire directories while preserving metadata, timestamps, and relative paths. Built-in security features prevent path traversal attacks, symlink exploits, and archive recursion.

### 💻 Dual Interface
- **CLI**: Full-featured command-line interface with `create`, `extract`, `compress`, `decompress`, `list`, `verify`, and inline `--benchmark` commands
- **GUI**: User-friendly Tkinter application with background threading, real-time progress bars, password fields, and operation cancellation

### ⚡ Production-Ready
All 137 tests pass. Comprehensive test coverage includes algorithm correctness, encryption validation, archive security, integration workflows, and performance regression checks. The codebase uses modern Python 3.10+ features with full type hints and extensive documentation.

## What's New in v1.0.0

This is the initial production release, consolidating the project's development history:
- ✅ Complete algorithm implementations (LZW, Huffman, DEFLATE)
- ✅ Full encryption and security features
- ✅ Archive format with metadata preservation
- ✅ CLI and GUI interfaces with progress tracking
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and benchmarking
- ✅ Documentation and developer guides

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Quick compress
techcompressor compress input.txt output.tc --algo DEFLATE

# Create encrypted archive
techcompressor create my_folder/ backup.tc --algo DEFLATE --password mypassword

# Extract archive
techcompressor extract backup.tc restored/ --password mypassword

# Launch GUI
techcompressor-gui
```

## Migration Notes

**Not applicable** - this is the initial release. Future versions will maintain backward compatibility with the v1.0.0 API and archive format.

## Known Issues

1. **Compression Pattern Leakage**: Compressed data reveals patterns even with encryption enabled. This is an inherent limitation of compress-then-encrypt approaches and is not a bug. For maximum security, consider encrypt-then-compress workflows in security-critical applications.

2. **Intentional Key Derivation Delay**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations introduces a ~50-100ms delay during encryption/decryption. This is a deliberate security feature to resist brute-force attacks and should not be "optimized away."

3. **No Password Recovery**: There is no password recovery mechanism. Data encrypted with a forgotten password is permanently irrecoverable. This is by design—we do not store password hints or backdoors.

4. **Tkinter GUI Platform Limitations**: The GUI requires a display server (X11, Wayland, or Windows). Headless servers should use the CLI interface.

## Recommended Usage

**Algorithm Selection**:
- **General purpose**: DEFLATE (best overall compression)
- **Speed-critical**: LZW (fastest, lowest memory)
- **Text/source code**: DEFLATE with single-stream mode
- **Mixed content**: LZW with per-file mode
- **Media files**: Skip re-compression (already compressed formats)

**Archive Modes**:
- **Per-file mode**: Better for random access, selective extraction, and mixed content types
- **Single-stream mode**: Better compression ratio for similar files (e.g., source code)

**Security**:
- Use strong passwords (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Store passwords in a password manager, never in code
- Verify password before long compression operations
- Consider the compression pattern leakage limitation for highly sensitive data

## System Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `cryptography>=41.0.0` (AES-GCM, PBKDF2)
- `tqdm>=4.65.0` (progress bars)
- `pytest>=7.0.0` (development/testing)
