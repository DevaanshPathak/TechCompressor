# TechCompressor v1.1.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: Production/Stable

## Overview

TechCompressor v1.1.0 brings RAR-competitive features to the production framework: solid compression with dictionary persistence for 10-30% better compression ratios, PAR2-style recovery records for archive repair, and multi-threaded compression support. This release maintains the robust foundation of three compression algorithms, military-grade encryption, and intuitive interfaces while adding advanced archive features that rival commercial tools.

## Highlights

### 🗜️ Three Compression Algorithms
Choose the algorithm that fits your needs:
- **LZW**: Lightning-fast dictionary-based compression (3 MB/s), ideal for repetitive data and speed-critical applications
- **Huffman**: Frequency-based compression optimized for non-uniform distributions (2.5 MB/s)
- **DEFLATE**: Industry-standard hybrid compression (LZ77 + Huffman) offering the best compression ratios (6 MB/s, ~1% on repetitive data)

### 🔒 Military-Grade Security
Password-protected compression uses **AES-256-GCM** authenticated encryption with **PBKDF2** key derivation (100,000 iterations). Every encryption generates unique salts and nonces, and includes integrity verification via authentication tags. There are no backdoors or recovery mechanisms—security by design.

### 📦 Flexible Archiving
The custom **TCAF** (TechCompressor Archive Format) supports both per-file and single-stream compression modes. Compress entire directories while preserving metadata, timestamps, and relative paths. Built-in security features prevent path traversal attacks, symlink exploits, and archive recursion.

### 💻 Dual Interface
- **CLI**: Full-featured command-line interface with `create`, `extract`, `compress`, `decompress`, `list`, `verify`, and inline `--benchmark` commands
- **GUI**: User-friendly Tkinter application with background threading, real-time progress bars, password fields, and operation cancellation

### ⚡ Production-Ready
All 137 tests pass. Comprehensive test coverage includes algorithm correctness, encryption validation, archive security, integration workflows, and performance regression checks. The codebase uses modern Python 3.10+ features with full type hints and extensive documentation.

## What's New in v1.1.0

### 🔗 Solid Compression Mode (Dictionary Persistence)
Archive creation now supports persistent LZW dictionaries across multiple files, achieving **10-30% better compression ratios** on archives with similar content:
- Global dictionary state maintained between files with `persist_dict=True`
- `reset_solid_compression_state()` function to clear state between archives
- Automatic dictionary resets prevent memory overflow
- Ideal for source code repositories, log archives, and document collections

### 🛡️ Recovery Records (PAR2-Style Error Correction)
Archives can now include **Reed-Solomon parity blocks** for automatic corruption repair:
- Configurable redundancy: 0-10% of archive size
- XOR-based block encoding with 64KB block size
- `generate_recovery_records()` and `apply_recovery()` functions in new `recovery.py` module
- Recovery footer with `RCVR` marker for backward compatibility
- Repairs bit rot, transmission errors, and partial media failures

### ⚡ Multi-Threaded Compression
Parallel per-file compression support via `ThreadPoolExecutor`:
- `max_workers` parameter in `create_archive()` function
- 2-4x faster compression on multi-core systems
- Automatic worker count based on CPU cores when `max_workers=None`
- Thread-safe progress tracking and error handling

### 📊 API Enhancements
- **STORED mode** (algorithm ID 0): Direct storage for incompressible files (no expansion)
- Enhanced AUTO mode: Smart heuristics skip slow algorithms on large files
- Entropy detection: Automatically detects already-compressed data
- Updated function signatures maintain backward compatibility

## Breaking Changes

**None** - v1.1.0 is fully backward compatible with v1.0.0. Existing archives decompress correctly, and all v1.0.0 API calls work unchanged.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Quick compress
techcompressor compress input.txt output.tc --algo DEFLATE

# Create encrypted archive with recovery records
techcompressor create my_folder/ backup.tc --algo DEFLATE --password mypassword --recovery-percent 5

# Extract archive
techcompressor extract backup.tc restored/ --password mypassword

# Launch GUI
techcompressor-gui
```

## Migration from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0

**API Changes**: None required - all v1.0.0 code works unchanged.

**New Features** (optional adoption):
```python
from techcompressor import compress, reset_solid_compression_state
from techcompressor.archiver import create_archive
from techcompressor.recovery import generate_recovery_records

# Use solid compression for better ratios
create_archive("source/", "output.tc", persist_dict=True)

# Add recovery records (5% redundancy)
create_archive("source/", "output.tc", recovery_percent=5.0)

# Parallel compression
create_archive("source/", "output.tc", max_workers=4)

# Reset state between archives
reset_solid_compression_state()
```

**Archive Format**: TCAF v2 is backward compatible with v1 archives. Old archives decompress correctly. New features (STORED mode, recovery records) are only used in newly created archives.

## Known Issues

1. **Compression Pattern Leakage**: Compressed data reveals patterns even with encryption enabled. This is an inherent limitation of compress-then-encrypt approaches and is not a bug. For maximum security, consider encrypt-then-compress workflows in security-critical applications.

2. **Intentional Key Derivation Delay**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations introduces a ~50-100ms delay during encryption/decryption. This is a deliberate security feature to resist brute-force attacks and should not be "optimized away."

3. **No Password Recovery**: There is no password recovery mechanism. Data encrypted with a forgotten password is permanently irrecoverable. This is by design—we do not store password hints or backdoors.

4. **Tkinter GUI Platform Limitations**: The GUI requires a display server (X11, Wayland, or Windows). Headless servers should use the CLI interface.

## Recommended Usage

**Algorithm Selection**:
- **General purpose**: DEFLATE (best overall compression)
- **Speed-critical**: LZW (fastest, lowest memory)
- **Text/source code**: DEFLATE with single-stream mode + solid compression
- **Mixed content**: LZW with per-file mode
- **Media files**: STORED mode automatically used for incompressible data

**Archive Modes**:
- **Per-file mode** (`per_file=True`): Better for random access, selective extraction, mixed content
- **Single-stream mode** (`per_file=False`): Better compression ratio for similar files
- **Solid compression** (`persist_dict=True`): 10-30% better ratios, use with per_file=True

**Recovery Records**:
- Use 2-5% redundancy for normal archives
- Use 5-10% for critical backups or unreliable media
- Recovery records add minimal overhead but enable corruption repair

**Security**:
- Use strong passwords (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Store passwords in a password manager, never in code
- Verify password before long compression operations
- Consider the compression pattern leakage limitation for highly sensitive data

## System Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `cryptography>=41.0.0` (AES-GCM, PBKDF2)
